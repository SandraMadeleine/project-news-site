# News Site

The project was to create a news site with a header, one large news item, and several smaller item. The site needs to be responsive to fit mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I underestimated the time needed, as many times when I tried something new, it would ruin all the content. Also I am in over my head with the combining of flexbox and grid and I will adjust this project to be only grid most likely. I planned the layout first, then wrote my article content and my headlines, then went on to finding suitable images and finally styling it all. For styling I have tried to have a somewhat logical order of everything and it has also taken some time to try to write clean code. I also spent too much time on trying to find alternatives to divide my text, since line breaks are not in use, byt this just made it look worse so I went back to just a paragraph as it is, per article.
